<p>Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. the first mouse quickly gave up and drowned. The second mouse, wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse. I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell. At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee if it'd brought you back to the world!
